          <p>
            I was born on October 18th, 1996 in La Paz, Bolivia. I lived in
            Bolivia until I was 15 and I moved with my dad to North Carolina,
            USA. There I learned to speak English and graduated from high
            school. I came back to Bolivia to study Computer Science Engineering
            and graduated in 2019. Right now, I'm looking for opportunities to
            develop my skills as a programmer in web and mobile development, AI
            and as a Cloud Services engineer to help make my country and the
            world a better place. My hobbies are traveling, photography,
            videogames and volleyball.

          <h3>Huawei ICT Competition 2018-2019</h3>
          <h6>Global Final 3rd Price Winner</h6>
          <p>
            I participated in Huawei’s ICT Competition on the Cloud Track and
            with my team made our way to the global final in Shenzhen, China
            where we got the 3rd prize! I had an amazing experience learning a
            lot about Cloud Services, AI and Big Data. I also got the
            opportunity to see Huawei’s Solutions and Innovation expo and got a
            mind opening look at what the future looks like motivating me to
            build a better world. And last but not least I loved getting to know
            friends from all over the world and learning about different
            cultures.<br />

          <h3>Bolivian Postal Agency</h3>
          <h6>Full Stack Developer Internship</h6>
          <p>
            I did a small module of the Bolivian Postal Agency intern software
            from zero. I did everything from data base modeling to backend and
            front end. It was an interesting experience because they were
            rebuilding and updating their software, so I had to go asking the
            employees that were going to use my software how things worked
            around there, and based on what they told me I designed all the
            structure of the module. I learned to use the Laravel framework and
            how to plan and design everything needed for a full stack
            application in that framework.

          <h3>University Social Security</h3>
          <h6>Mobile Developer Internship</h6>
          <p>
            I developed a mobile application based on a system about
            reservations and emergencies of the University Social Security. A
            desktop application system already existed and I had to use and
            upgrade a little bit of the backend to be able to implement it with
            an Android app. The application consisted of two parts: booking of
            doctor’s appointments and emergency button that sends location and
            medical history to authorities. I learned how to use Android Studio
            and how to integrate an existing system to a new application.
